## About Us
Our laboratory includes a diverse body of researchers working on the development of novel scientific techniques as well as tools to enhance software quality attributes such as security, privacy, and safety. 
Our research has mainly been supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). We are interested in developing novel artificial intelligence, as well as source code analysis techniques to solve software engineering problems. Our researchers have developed automated techniques to facilitate software assurance activities, requirements verification, and design reasoning. We actively collaborate with industrial partners and federal agencies.
